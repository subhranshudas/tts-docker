## Basic TTS reader

A very barebones TTS reader for using docker to read stuff on local


### Google TTS API
make sure to have the service-account.json from Google when running docker


### Using the system
1. create an input file under `input/`
2. Run `docker compose up`
3. check the `output/` for the same name
